            <h3>Building Career, Learning Code, Developing Skills</h3>
            <p>I must be coming across as someone with a real passion for technology, especially software development!
                My
                comfort with Git commands reflects my interest in how version control systems work, and I always have
                questions because I'm curious to understand things better. This drive to learn keeps me exploring
                different
                approaches, like the safer way to push commits on Git. In short, I'd say I'm a tech-savvy individual
                who's
                always looking to expand my knowledge base. </p>

            <h3>Become A Web Developer</h3>
            <p>I have already learned basic HTML and CSS. I can now design simple websites. I can even teach my grandma
                to build a simple website for her. My goal is to build 3 websites as a developer with advanced topics.

                <h3>2017-2020 | Programming learner</h3>
                <p>I learned code to develop my skillset. I made some websites and added to my portfolio. I showcased
                    them
                    to a company and they offered me a job. I have worked as a junior developer there for 1 year and
                    develop
                    a few websites as well. And also, I have learned some other things during that job.</p>
