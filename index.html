            <h3>Building Career, Learning Code, Developing Skills</h3>
            <p>I must be coming across as someone with a real passion for technology, especially software development!
                My
                comfort with Git commands reflects my interest in how version control systems work, and I always have
                questions because I'm curious to understand things better. This drive to learn keeps me exploring
                different
                approaches, like the safer way to push commits on Git. In short, I'd say I'm a tech-savvy individual
                who's
                always looking to expand my knowledge base. </p>
